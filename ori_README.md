# gerrit-tree
****


- Chrome extension to display code diff on gerrit in tree format. 
- Gerrit's native file list is cluttered, and combining the review page with file checks in one area makes navigating between files laborious.
-  Our plugin transforms this into a streamlined tree view and adds one-click jumps to the review page, optimizing the workflow for Gerrit code reviewers.
