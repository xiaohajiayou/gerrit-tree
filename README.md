# gerrit-tree
****

- Gerrit's native file list is `cluttered`, and `combining` the review page with file checks in one area makes navigating between files laborious.

Our plugin(Chrome extension to display code diff on gerrit in tree format. ) transforms this into a streamlined `tree view` and adds `one-click` jumps to the review page, optimizing the workflow for Gerrit code reviewers.
