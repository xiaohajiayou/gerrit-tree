****

- Gerrit's native file list is cluttered, and combining the review page with file checks in one area makes navigating between files laborious.

Our plugin(Chrome extension to display code diff on gerrit in tree format. ) transforms this into a streamlined tree view and adds one-click jumps to the review page, optimizing the workflow for Gerrit code reviewers.
